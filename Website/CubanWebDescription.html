      <p>
      The Weather Based Cuban Link is a jewelry chain that can light up different
      colors based on the current weather. <br>
      The link will pull weather data from an accompanying app, and throughout the
      day individual pixels/lights will light up, eventually forming a full display
      of the day at midnight and noon. <br>

      The chain will be able to support multiple modes that can be changed through
      the app. <br>
      Currently the planned modes include weather clock, customized color setting,
      and a real time color update based on the weather. <br>
      The weather clock mode mode
      is a mode that will incrementally light up chains on the link as the day
      progresses, and at midnight the chain will shine brightest with all of the
      colors recorded throughout the day on a respective link. <br>
      The custom color mode will be a color picker wheel that users can manipulate
      to make their chain shine in whatever color they choose. <br>
      The lights will be able to be made brighter and dimmer through the color
      picker as well. <br>
      The real time weather mode will work much like a mood ring that reacts to the
      weather. <br>
      Depending on the current weather, the chain will flow through colors that
       represent the current climate in the area. <br>

      Please refer to our project proposal for all of the materials and their expected costs.

      <h1>Hardware: </h1>
      <h2>Arduino</h2>
      <p>
      The largest piece of hardware that will be introduced into our chain is
      the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. <br>
      This arduino has capabilities that include a
      9 axis Inertial Measurement Unit, temperature, pressure, humidity, light, color
      and even gestures sensors, and a microphone. <br> Using these sensors, we would
      program the device to be able to support modes such as real real time weather
      mode and collect data that is relevant to the user.
      <br>
      Because the device is bluetooth connected, this is the mode of
      communication that we would use to connect to the device via phone/app.
      <br>
      Because the BLE was not able to supply 5v of power to our neopixel LEDs, we added a 
      second arduino to our hardware. We have included a Arduino Uno that's sole purpose is 
      to handle displaying and sending color information to our LEDs. The Arduino Uno recieves
      information about what colors to display from the Arduino BLE. This board to board communication is handled through master-slave I2C communication.
      </p>

      <h2>Neopixel Jewels</h2>
      <p>
      Neopixel jewels will be the main electronic light that will be used throughout
      the project. <br>
      Each link on the chain will contain a neopixel jewel, and will be
      run in series starting from the arduino at the back of the chain. <br>
      The arduino
      will power the lights when on, and will also be the medium for passing rgb
      values to the lights.
      <br>
      </p>

    <div class="body_section">
      <h1>Software: </h1>
      <p>
      Our software will also be a large component of the project. <br>
      The app itself will be the hub that controls what mode the chain is in,
      as well as responding with the status of the chain such as battery, weather,
      and current light colors. <br>
      The app will be crucial for connecting over bluetooth,
      which is a main feature that must be implemented.<br>
      The app contains two screens for users to interact with.<br>
      The first screen is a home screen that includes the current mode of the cuban link,
      whether the cuban link is connected over bluetooth, the current RGB values on the 
      cuban link, and the current temperature around the user. <br>
      Here are examples of what our app looks like:
